Example code for Brightfield Multiview Reconstruction as described in Calisesi et al. ----- (2020)

The code reconstructs a single section (y) of a sample acquired in brightfield mode from multiple angles.

The data should be ordered (resliced after multi-view acquisition) in the following order:
                                [angles, z, x]
                                
Please read Calisesi et al. for details on acquisition and on the coordinates definition.  

In order to reconstruct a full 3D sample, the code should be run section by section 
or could be modified to take into account 3D multiview stacks. Please contact
the corresponding author if you need help in performing this step.

shown in Calisesi et al., Supplementary Figure 2. Pixelsize is 1.625um.

Please note that the resliced data have been previously interpolated to provide isotropic 
sampling in x and z and zero padded to obtain a squared image. 
This step could be avoided to significantly increase reconstruction speed.

Along the x direction the data have been centered following the method described in Calisesi et al. (Fig 3).
